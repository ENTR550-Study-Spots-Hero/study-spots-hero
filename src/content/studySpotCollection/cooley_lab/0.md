Located: Outside study spot located behind Cooley, can be accessed through he basement doors of the building, benches located all around the fountain (some in shade and some in sun)

#### Sketch
- Not a lot of foot traffic in the area, for outdoor seating it is pretty comfortable, lots of trees and pretty scenery 
- Really comforable.
- Usually empty.
- No restrooms on the same floor.


#### Notes
- Right near the bus stop, very easily accessible 
- perfect spot to study in in the fall if you enjoy studying outside but are looking for a quieter area than say the diag.
