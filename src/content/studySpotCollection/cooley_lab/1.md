Located: room 1929

#### Sketch
- The bathroom is right across the hall as well as a Caen lab in room 1934, so there is access to computers nearby if needed.
- Really comforable.
- Usually empty.
- Restrooms within reach.


#### Notes
- seen in picture, there is a bookshelf wall that has an attached ladder which is a neat feature of the room
- can go back for more pics for website if needed!
