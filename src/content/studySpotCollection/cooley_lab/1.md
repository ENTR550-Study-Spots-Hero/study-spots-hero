# Study Spot 1 in cooley_lab

location details: room 1929

The bathroom is right across the hall as well as a Caen lab in room 1934, so there is access to computers nearby if needed.

seen in picture, there is a bookshelf wall that has an attached ladder which is a neat feature of the room



can go back for more pics for website if needed!
