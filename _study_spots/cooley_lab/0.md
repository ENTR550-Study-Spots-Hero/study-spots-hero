# Study Spot 0 in cooley_lab

location details: Outside study spot located behind Cooley, can be accessed through he basement doors of the building, benches located all around the fountain (some in shade and some in sun)

Not a lot of foot traffic in the area, for outdoor seating it is pretty comfortable, lots of trees and pretty scenery 

Right near the bus stop, very easily accessible 

perfect spot to study in in the fall if you enjoy studying outside but are looking for a quieter area than say the diag.
